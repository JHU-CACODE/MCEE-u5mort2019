# Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals:  a systematic analysis for estimating global, regional, and national causes of under-five mortality during 2000-2019

Code and functions for paper by Jamie PERIN, Amy MULICK, Diana YEUNG, Francisco VILLAVICENCIO, Gerard LOPEZ, Kathleen L STRONG, David PRIETO-MERINO, Simon COUSENS, Robert E BLACK and Li LIU, published at The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, 2021.

This repository contains two folders (neonatal_cod, postneonatal_cod), each of which is organised into subfolders containing code, data and results.

## Neonatal (0-28 days) cause-of-death fractions

To reproduce the model-based estimates, the following five files should be run in sequence:

1. Estimate_VA.R
2. Estimate_VR1.R
3. Estimate_VR2.R
4. Predict.R
5. Compile_VAVR.R

Functions, statistical models and datasets required to run them are included in the subfolders.


## Child (1-59 months) cause-of-death fractions

To reproduce the model-based estimates, the following five files should be run in sequence:

1.  Estimate_VA.R
2.  Estimate_VR.R
3.  Predict_VA.R
4.  Predict_VR.R
5.  Model_Averaging.R

Functions, statistical models and datasets required to run them are included in the subfolders.


## Combine estimated cause fractions and envelopes

The code to reproduce the final estimates is in the main file:

child_cod_2000-2019.R 

This script further parcels out and/or adjusts estimates for measles, TB, crisis, HIV, and malaria (outside high endemicity areas) deaths as described in the paper.
